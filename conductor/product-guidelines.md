# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Style
- **Professional and Direct:** The application should use clear, concise, and objective language. Avoid jargon where possible, but use correct engineering terminology when appropriate.
- **Action-Oriented:** Prompts and notifications should clearly indicate what action is required from the user (e.g., "Review Task," "Approve Assignment").

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Efficiency First:** The workflow is designed to minimize clicks. Task review and approval should be as frictionless as possible.
- **Transparency:** The AI's reasoning (e.g., why a deadline was chosen) should be visible or easily accessible to build trust.
- **Fail-Safe:** Users must always have the final say. The AI *proposes*, but the human *decides*. Edit capabilities are mandatory before any task is finalized.

## Visual Design
- **Information Density:** The dashboard should present key information (deadline, project, discipline) upfront to facilitate rapid decision-making.
- **Functional Hierarchy:** Use standard visual cues (e.g., red for high priority/overdue) to direct attention to critical items.
- **Consistency:** Adhere to standard UI patterns (Streamlit defaults) to ensure a familiar and predictable experience.
